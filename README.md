you can run 2.2 and 2.3.

2.2 use the code skeleton provid.
2.3 don't need other files to run, 
you can change the paramaters of 2.3 at the beginning of the files (mu, tau, N...).
because we use log, it is not possible to make N to high (>300), to do that we need to remove thr log (too 
small values)
